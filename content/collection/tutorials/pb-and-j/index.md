**Peanut butter and jelly** (PB&J) sandwiches are a popular snack for all ages. There are endless variations of this timeless classic, but the core process for assembling a PB&J is the same. Below, we'll cover how to make a basic PB&J sandwich.

### Ingredient Choice

There are three core ingredients for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich: **peanut butter**, **jelly**, and **bread**. If you want to get fancy and toast your bread, you'll also need some **butter.** Let's talk about the peanut butter first.

Broadly speaking there are two main categories of peanut butter: smooth and chunky. Which one you use is a matter of personal preference. Some people love the crunch and textural contrast of chunky peanut butter, while others prefer the creaminess of smooth peanut butter. Flavor-wise, both are virtually the same.

For the jelly, grape is a classic flavor, but strawberry is also popular. You can also use jam if you prefer, but of course then it would not be a peanut butter and _jelly_ sandwich.

The last piece of the puzzle is the bread. Sliced white sandwich bread is the classic choice, but feel free to spice your sandwich up with whole wheat, brioche, or even rye bread. While you could use artisan loaves like baguettes or boules, be aware that any extra add-ins or flavors in your bread might clash with the peanut butter and jelly. Also, make sure your bread is either pre-sliced, or that you're able to slice it yourself (a bread knife works best).

### Putting it All Together

Once you've obtained your ingredients, it's time to assemble your sandwich. Double check that you have the following: 

- Two slices of bread
- Two to three tablespoons of peanut butter
- Two to three tablespoons of jelly
- Optional: two tablespoons of butter for toasting your bread
  - If you're toasting your bread, you'll also need a pan -- either nonstick, stainless steel, or cast iron all work

Follow the steps below, and you'll be noshing on your creation in no time:

0. If you're toasting your bread, first melt the butter in a pan (both nonstick and stainless steel work) over medium-low heat. When the butter is melted, put both your bread slices into the pan and toast both sides until golden brown. Remove and let the bread cool on a plate afterwards.
1. Using a spoon or butter knife, spread the peanut butter on one slice of bread until it's evenly distributed. Make sure the entire slice is covered from edge to edge.
2. Next, spread the jelly on the other slice of bread, making sure it's also evenly distributed.
3. Place the slices together with the peanut butter and jelly sides facing towards each other.
4. As an optional step, if you dislike bread crusts, trim the crusts off all four sides of your sandwich.

Your sandwich is ready to enjoy!
