This manual is a written version of the assembly instructions for the IKEA Pahl desk, article number `491.289.45`.

**Note:** You will need a Phillips head screwdriver to assemble this desk.

## Safety Warning

To protect the desk and surroundings from damage during assembly, use a carpet, blanket, or other shock-absorbing material. Make sure there is also enough space around you while you work.

If you have any questions or concerns about the assembly process, please contact the IKEA store where you bought your product.

## Included Components
Your Pahl desk should come with the following parts:

- 1 Desk top (37 3/4" x 22 7/8")
- 1 Underframe for desk top
  - 4 Upper leg frame
  - 4 Lower leg frame
  - 2 Cable trays
- 4 Flat Phillips head screws
- 12 Rounded Phillips head screws
- 4 Height adjustment knobs
- 1 Screw holder

# Instructions

### Assembling the upper part of the desk

1. Flip the desk top so the side with the screw holes is facing up.
2. Place 1 flat Phillips head screw in the screw hole closest to each corner of the desk top.
3. Using the screw holder, tighten each screw until the top of the screw head is level with the screw holder. **DO NOT TIGHTEN THE SCREWS ALL THE WAY.**
4. Align each of the upper leg frames with the desk top such that all the screw holes match up.
5. Fit the flat Phillips head screws on the desk top into the wide part of the keyhole slots in the leg frames. Then slide the screw into the narrow part of the keyhole to lock the screw and frame in place. Repeat this process for all four upper leg frames.
6. Insert the rounded Phillips head screws into the remaining holes on the desk top, three per corner. Tighten all the screws around the table only halfway at first, then tighten them all the way.

### Attaching the lower legs

**Note:** The Pahl desk can be adjusted to three different heights depending on your needs. Decide what height you'd like the desk to be at before proceeding with assembly.

1. Slide the four lower leg frames into the upper legs, making sure the height adjustment holes are facing inwards. Align the screw hole on the upper leg frame with correct screw hole for your chosen height on the lower leg.
2. Carefully flip the table onto its side.
3. Take a cable tray and fit it between both table legs on one side. The screw holes on the tray and the legs should align, and the taller side of the cable tray should be on the outside.
4. Insert two height adjustment knobs into the screw holes in the cable tray, tightening until the knobs are firmly in place and there is no wobbling.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for the cable tray on the other side.

Now your Pahl desk is fully assembled. Carefully flip the table upright and enjoy your new desk!
