The following are links to my contributions to the open-source PC and mobile application VTube Studio. I reworked the existing documentation to be more user-friendly:
- Added clearer navigation options to the home page
- Created a "Getting Started" guide for new users
- Improved documentation organization by consolidating information that was previously fragmented across multiple pages

### 1. [VTube Studio Home Page](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki)

### 2. [VTube Studio Getting Started Page](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Getting-Started)

The following are entries I've written as part of the community-driven documentation at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs). These entries span a variety of programming languages and aim to provide a basic overview of terms and concepts.

### 1. [MySQL .hex()](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/mysql/hex)

### 2. [Python Plotly .funnel()](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/plotly/express/funnel)

### 3. [C++ .count()](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cpp/maps/count)
