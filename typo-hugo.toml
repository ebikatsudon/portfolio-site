I'm a writer and editor with a background in market research and content development. I love learning new things and helping others learn by figuring out how to communicate information in easy-to-understand ways.

Recently I've been channeling that experience and passion into a growing interest in technical writing and scientific communication. Iâ€™m currently building my portfolio and looking for opportunities to contribute to tech-focused projects where clear, well-written documentation makes a real impact.

You can learn more about me [here](/resume), or view some of the projects I've contributed to [here](/projects).
